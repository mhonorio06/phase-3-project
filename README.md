# phase-3-project

Welcome to my sightseeing app!

Whether your thoughts on waterfalls are like mine, being majestic pieces of landscape that the world has ever known. Each time you are in front of it there is something that drives people to be there so I decided to create an interface where you could see all the different waterfalls in all different the countries so that when the time came to go and visit them you could know where they are and how to find them. 

Many times I have found myself searching for different waterfalls so that one day I could make a plan to go and visit them; wouldn't it would be a wonderful thing where you could search in a country to find where all those waterfalls are located at so that you could go and see them too!

#Setup

First I started off by creating my models folder for my classes. I started by creating a database in my init file so then I would create the tables for each class. One was a country class and the other was waterfalls. It is a one to many relationship by how many waterfalls belong to one country. I used the built-in decorator property functions to set each property as a private member to only be accessed in each class. After setting up my mehods for each class I made a cli file to be able use those methods to create the interface.

#credits

I would like to give credit to Flatiron school, after watching a lot of the videos it gave me an insight of how I wanted the interface to look, as well as scheduling times for technical hours. It was a lot trial and error, trying things out until I found a way for everything to work out the way I wanted it to.
